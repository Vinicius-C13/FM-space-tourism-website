# FM-space-tourism-website
This a project about a space tourism site.
My goal with this project was improve my habilities in HTML, CSS and JS, focusing my attention mainly in CSS.
I learned a lot about: 
  - layout building using flexbox and grid; 
  - how to use conditionals like @media, 
  - how to organize my CSS code better and how to turn my code more reusable using utility classes.

At the end, I believe that I'm a better front-end developer, now I now how to use more tools of CSS and, the most important for me, I now how to write a cleaner CSS code.
